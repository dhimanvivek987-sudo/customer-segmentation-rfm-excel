# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis (Excel & Power Query)

## Project Overview

This project performs **Customer Segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** on raw transactional data to identify **high-value, loyal, at-risk, and new customers**.

The entire workflow is built **end-to-end in Microsoft Excel**, using **Power Query for data cleaning and merging**, **Excel formulas for analytics**, and **PivotTables & dashboards** for business insights.

This project simulates a **real-world Business Analyst use case**, starting from messy raw data and ending with **actionable marketing recommendations**.

## Business Objectives

- Segment customers based on purchasing behavior
- Identify **VIP / high-value customers**
- Detect **at-risk customers** with churn signals
- Enable **data-driven marketing strategies**
- Showcase **Power Query, Excel analytics, and business thinking**

## Dataset Description

### Raw Data Sources

| File | Description |
|----|------------|
| `transactions.csv` | Transaction-level purchase data |
| `customers.csv` | Customer master data |

### Key Transaction Columns

- `transaction_id`
- `customer_id`
- `product_name`
- `product_category`
- `quantity`
- `price`
- `transaction_date`
- `store_location`
- `payment_method`
- `discount_applied`

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query
- Advanced Excel formulas (`IF`, `AND`, `QUARTILE.INC`)
- PivotTables & PivotCharts
- Conditional Formatting
- Business analytics & segmentation logic

---

## Data Preparation & Modeling

### Data Cleaning (Power Query)

- Removed records with missing `customer_id`
- Replaced missing quantities using business assumption (`quantity = 1`)
- Filtered invalid data (`quantity > 0`, `price > 0`)
- Converted columns to correct data types
- Created `total_amount = quantity × price`

---

### Data Merging (Power Query)

- Performed **Left Join** between:
  - `transactions.csv` and `customers.csv`
- Join key: `customer_id`
- Result: **Enriched transaction dataset**

---

### Customer-Level Aggregation

Data was aggregated to **one row per customer**:

| Metric | Description |
|-----|------------|
| Last Purchase Date | Most recent transaction |
| Purchase Frequency | Number of transactions |
| Total Spent | Total monetary value |
| Average Order Value | Mean transaction value |
