# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis (Excel & Power Query)

## Project Description

This project demonstrates an end-to-end customer segmentation analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework.  
The entire workflow is implemented in Microsoft Excel, leveraging Power Query for data cleaning and merging, and Excel formulas, PivotTables, and dashboards for analysis and visualization.

The project simulates a real-world Business Analyst use case, starting from raw transactional data and ending with actionable insights to support marketing and customer retention strategies.
